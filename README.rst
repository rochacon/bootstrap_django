This is a simple Django project template.

The bootstrap_django.py script will render all the configurations and replace variables with your context data.

Go to line 20 on the bootstrap_django.py script to see the available configurations.

After configuring your context info, run the bootstrap_django.py script and start writing your awesome project!!

Requirements:
	Django>=1.3 (maybe it can run in older versions, but it wasn't tested)
